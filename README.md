# Docker Practice 3

## Networking in Docker

- none
- host
- bridge

### None network driver

- Let's start the container using the none-driver.
- We use joffotron/docker-net-tools as an image.
- We do this to save time and effort. 
  - It already includes the necessary utilities for working with the network: 
    - the bind-tools;
    - net-tools;
    - and curl packages.
- The container will start a sleep process with a timer for 100 seconds.
- After 100 seconds have elapsed, the container will be stopped and removed (--rm flag).

Let's run:
```
docker run --network none --rm -d --name net_test joffotron/docker-net-tools -c "sleep 100"
```

Then:
```
docker exec -ti net_test ifconfig
```

As a result, we see:
- that only loopback exists inside the container from network interfaces.
- the network stack of the container itself works (ping localhost), but without the ability to contact the outside world.
- This means that you can even run network services inside such a container, but only for local experiments 
  - testing;
  - containers for performing one-time tasks;
  - etc.

### Host network driver

Let's start the container in the network space of the docker host:
```
docker run --network host --rm -d --name net_test joffotron/docker-net-tools -c "sleep 100"
```

Compare the output of the commands:
```
docker exec -ti net_test ifconfig
```

And
```
ifconfig
```

Run several times (2-4):
```
docker run --network host -d nginx
```

What is the result?

  --network="bridge" : Connect a container to a network
  <li>'bridge': create a network stack on the default Docker bridge</li>
  <li>'none': no networking</li>

What did the next command give?

  <li>List containers</li>

</details>

Why do you think?

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  <li>Only last version of the container is relevant</li>
</details>

Stop all running containers:
```
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

### Docker networks

On the docker-host machine, run the command:
```
sudo ln -s /var/run/docker/netns /var/run/netns
```

You can now view the currently existing net-namespaces with the command:
```
sudo ip netns
```

Task: Re-launch containers using the none and host drivers and see how the list of namespaces changes.

Command below will allow to execute commands in the selected namespace:
```
sudo ip netns exec <namespace> <command>
```

Example:
```
sudo ip netns exec 195847b8dda1 ls
```

### Microservice app

This practice uses the microservice version of the application from Docker Practice 2.

Download the repository from the microservices branch:
```
git clone -b microservices https://github.com/yagubern/app.git
```

Let's collect images for each service:
```
export USER_NAME=<your_login>
cd app/comment
chmod u+x ./docker_build.sh
bash docker_build.sh
cd ../post-py
chmod u+x ./docker_build.sh
bash docker_build.sh
cd ../ui
chmod u+x ./docker_build.sh
bash docker_build.sh
```

### Bridge network driver

Create a bridge network in docker (the --driver flag is optional, because the default is bridge):
```
docker network create app --driver bridge
```

Let's run our app project using a bridge network:
```
docker run -d --network=app mongo:latest
docker run -d --network=app <your-login>/post-py:latest
docker run -d --network=app <your-login>/comment:latest
docker run -d --network=app -p 127.0.0.1:9292:9292 <your-login>/ui:latest
```

Let's go to the address http://127.0.0.1:9292

![Something went wrongâ€¦](DockerPractice3_01.png)

In fact, our services refer to each other by dns names written in the code. 

In the current installation, the built-in DNS docker does not know anything about these names.

The solution to the problem is to assign names or network aliases to containers at startup:
```
--name <name> (only 1 name can be specified)
--network-alias <alias-name> (multiple aliases can be specified)
```

Stop old copies of containers:
```
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

Let's launch new:
```
docker run -d --network=app --network-alias=post_db --network-alias=comment_db mongo:latest
docker run -d --network=app --network-alias=post <your-login>/post-py:latest
docker run -d --network=app --network-alias=comment <your-login>/comment:latest
docker run -d --network=app -p 127.0.0.1:9292:9292 <your-login>/ui:latest
```

### Docker-compose

- One application consists of many containers / services
- One container depends on the other
- Startup order matters
- docker build / run / create ... (long and long)
- Standalone utility
- Declarative description of the docker infrastructure in YAML format
- Management of multi-container applications
- Syntax reference: https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

#### Plan

- Build app images using docker-compose
- Run app with docker-compose

#### docker-compose.yml

- Create a [docker-compose.yml](app/docker-compose.yml) file in the project directory.
- It is important that the ui, comment, post folders are next to each other.

Note that docker-compose supports
- Interpolation (substitution) of environment variables.
  - In this case, it is the USERNAME variable.
- Therefore, before starting, it is necessary to export the values of these environment variables.

Run:
```
export USERNAME=<your-login>
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
```

You should see a similar picture in the output:

Go to http://127.0.0.1:9292/
and make sure the project is working correctly
